This test task presents a sample of high-frequency data containing trades and updates to the limit order book. We have carefully concealed a substantial number of realistic errors in it, and your task is to identify as many errors as possible.

You don't need to show how you searched for errors, create plots, or perform any other analytics.
You also don't need to indicate the row numbers where you found errors.
The only thing required is a brief description (one line is enough) of the nature of each error found.
Task score - percentage of error types found.
